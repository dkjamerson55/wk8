<!--About sixIron paragraph-->
<p>
    Growing up in a small farming community in Texas, I have learned that hard work is a way of life. 
    My father taught me the importance of being able to fix anything that is broken yourself and helped me learn many different trades. <br>
    What began as building something out of necessity, turned into a love for creating custom wood furniture. 
    In today's throw away culture, I think it is still important to have furniture that will last a lifetime. <br> 
    Everyone can have a one of a kind piece of furniture that starts as a piece of art in their home and turns into a family heirloom. <br>
    Contact me to learn more about how I can work with you and create your next piece of six iron custom furniture.
